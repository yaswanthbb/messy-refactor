## ðŸ”§ What I Fixed and Why

- **It had SQL queries written as a string** â€” I changed them to use `?` parameters to avoid SQL injection.
- **Passwords were saved as plain text** â€” I used `Werkzeug.security` to hash the passwords before saving.
- **All the code was in one file (`app.py`)** â€” I moved the code into multiple files like `routes.py`, `models.py`, and `utils.py` to make it cleaner and easier to understand.
- **It didnâ€™t check if required fields were missing** â€” I added checks for `name`, `email`, and `password` in the input data.
- **Error messages were just plain strings** â€” I returned proper JSON messages with correct HTTP status codes like 200, 400, and 404.
- **Everything was returned as text** â€” I changed it to return data as JSON so itâ€™s easier to use with frontend.
- **There were no tests** â€” I added basic tests using `pytest` to make sure key endpoints like `/users` and `/login` work correctly.
